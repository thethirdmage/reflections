What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git folder appears with its info. If a repo isn't initialized, then there's no way to track changes/commit/etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area differs by only holding the files to be committed. It allows to only commit the files you want to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	You can look at the diff between the staging area and either the latest commit or the working directory,
	then only have the files included in said logical change be committed.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches help if you were to add an experimental feature, for example, if you don't want to mess up the main code and not remember commit IDs.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They show where branches differ from each other.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	It incorporates all the changes in each branch, and allows a feature, for example, to be added.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
