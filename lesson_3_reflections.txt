When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It allows multiple users to collaborate and push to the repo, and also allows to access it from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case a file you're working on is being changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are for when you want to copy another user's repo and make your own changes. Clones are for your personal copy to edit. Branches are part of the repo for the purposes of adding features, for example.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fast-forward commits are doable, and it can help with collaboration.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Could share code directly, but that would be annoying; and store files on a server.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when something you're doing may cause big changes in master.
